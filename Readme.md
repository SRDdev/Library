# Library Management System

## Overview

This Library Management System is a simple CLI-based application to manage books and users in a library. The application supports adding, listing, updating, and deleting books and users, as well as checking out and checking in books. The system also ensures that books are marked as unavailable when checked out and become available again when checked in. The data is stored in JSON files for persistence.

## Features

1. **Manage Books**
    - Add books
    - Update books
    - Delete books
    - List books
    - Search books by attributes (title, author, ISBN)
    - Ensure no duplicate ISBNs

2. **Manage Users**
    - Add users

3. **Check Out and Check In Books**
    - Mark books as unavailable when checked out
    - Mark books as available when checked in
    - Prevent checking out of already checked-out books

4. **Simple Logging**
    - Basic console logging for operations

5. **Error Handling and Input Validation**
    - Robust error handling
    - Input validation to ensure data integrity

6. **Modular and Scalable Design**
    - Easy to extend with new features
    - Clear separation of concerns

## Code Structure

The code is organized into multiple modules, each handling a specific part of the functionality:

```
.
├── data
│   ├── books.json
│   ├── users.json
│   └── checkouts.json
├── src
│   ├── book.py
│   ├── check.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── storage.py
│   └── user.py
├── main.py
└── README.md

```

## How to Run

1. **Install Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
     - macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install required packages (if any) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that this example does not use external libraries beyond `tabulate`, so this step is optional if `tabulate` is already installed.
4. **Run the Application**: Execute `python main.py` to start the CLI application.

## Example Usage

1. **Add a Book**:
   - Enter choice: `1`
   - Follow prompts to enter book details.
2. **List Books**:
   - Enter choice: `2`
   - View the list of available books.
3. **Add a User**:
   - Enter choice: `3`
   - Follow prompts to enter user details.
4. **Checkout a Book**:
   - Enter choice: `4`
   - Follow prompts to enter user ID and book ISBN.
5. **Check-in a Book**:
   - Enter choice: `5`
   - Follow prompts to enter user ID and book ISBN.
6. **Exit**:
   - Enter choice: `6`

## Future Enhancements

- Add more user-friendly error messages.
- Implement a GUI for easier interaction.
- Add more fields to the book and user models (e.g., publication year, user email).
- Include more comprehensive logging and auditing features.

## Scaling to Hundreds of Users

To scale the application:
- Backend: Use Django or Flask for efficient request handling.
- Database: Opt for PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalable data storage.
- Cloud Infrastructure: Deploy on AWS, Azure, or GCP for scalability.
- Load Balancing: Implement load balancing for optimal performance.
- Auto-scaling: Configure auto-scaling to handle spikes in traffic.
- Frontend: Use React or Angular for responsive UI.
- CI/CD: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools for performance tracking.
- Security: Ensure HTTPS, authentication, and data encryption.


## Conclusion

This Library Management System provides a basic framework for managing a library's books and users. The system ensures that book availability is accurately tracked and updated, and it supports essential operations such as adding, listing, and managing books and users. This project can serve as a foundation for more complex library management applications.
